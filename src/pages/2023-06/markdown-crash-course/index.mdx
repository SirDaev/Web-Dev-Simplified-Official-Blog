I love Markdown. It is a fairly easy to use markup language that lets you write simple text which can then be converted to HTML (or any other medium) with ease. It is used in many places, such as, GitHub README files, Reddit comments, and even this blog. That's right every article in this blog is written using Markdown which just goes to show how powerful Markdown is and in this quick article I will share everything you need to know about Markdown. Also, if you want you can check out the [source code for this article](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Web-Dev-Simplified-Official-Blog/tree/master/src/pages/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/index.mdx?plain=1) since it is written in Markdown. Just make sure you view the `Code` tab and not the `Preview` tab if you want to see what the actual code looks like.

Technically, my blog is written using MDX. MDX is very similar to Markdown, but it allows you to use React components within Markdown. This is how I am able to include the interactive Markdown editor you see throughout this article.

PS: I have a [complete Markdown cheat sheet](https://webdevsimplified.com/markdown-cheat-sheet.html) that covers everything you need to know about Markdown with visual examples that you can download for free.

## Markdown Basics

Markdown is mainly used to style and layout text so the first things we are going to cover are the absolute basic text layouts you can do with Markdown. Also, to create a markdown file you just need to end your file with the `.md` extension.

### Headings

Just like HTML, Markdown has six levels of headings. Headings in Markdown are created by putting one to six `#` in front of your heading text with a space separating the `#` and text. Each `#` represents a heading level with `#` being the largest heading and `######` being the smallest heading. Here is an example of all six heading levels.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6`}

/>

As you can see the more `#`'s we add the smaller the heading is. If you inspected the HTML generated you would notice each heading is actually just an `<h1>`-`<h6>` tag. Also, if you want you can edit the code above and your changes will be reflected on the right pane. Every code example in this article will have this feature so you can play around with the code and see the results instantly.

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are the default text layout. If you just type text it will automatically be converted to a paragraph. The only important thing to know about Markdown is that if you want to seperate text into two seperate paragraphs you need to add a blank line between each set of text. If you instead just want to have a new line within your paragraph you can add two spaces at the end of the line and it will be converted to a new line.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`This is a paragraph.
  
Since there is a new line between these two sentences they will be converted to two separate paragraphs.

This paragraph
has new lines in it
but
it will not show up as a new line in the output.

This paragraph
has two spaces HERE  
so it will push this onto a new line within the same paragraph.`}

/>

## Extended Markdown

One important thing to note about Markdown is that there are a lot of different variations, typically referred to as flavors. The base version of Markdown is quite a bit more limited in the formatting/styling you can do with it, but most websites that use Markdown will use some flavor which extends on Markdown. For example, GitHub uses a flavor of Markdown called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) which adds a lot of extra features to Markdown.

In this article I will be covering both the base Markdown features as well as some of the more common extended Markdown features found within GitHub Flavored Markdown as that is the most common Markdown flavor you will see. Whenever I talk about an extended feature I will make sure to mention that it is an extended feature and not part of the base Markdown specification.

## Text Styling

Besides just determing what element your text should render as, you can also determine how your text should be styled.

### Bold/Italics

The two most common types of text are bold and italics. These can be generated by using one `*` or `_` wrapping your text for italics or two `*` or `_` for bold.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`*This is italicized text*

_This is also italicized text_

**This is bold text**

__This is also bold text__`}
/>

In order to combine bold and italics you can just wrap your text in three `*` or `_` and it will be both bold and italicized.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`***This is both***

___This is also both___`}
/>

Generally, it is recommended to use `*` instead of `_` since somtimes Markdown does not work well if you have `_` in the middle of a word.

### Strikethrough

Here we come to our first extended Markdown feature. To create strikethrough text you can wrap your text in two `~` characters.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`~~Crossed off~~`}
/>

### Highlight 

Another extended Markdown feature is highlighting text. To highlight text you can wrap your text in two `=` characters. Unfortunately, GitHub Flavored Markdown does not support this feature so it will not work in the editor below, but you can use HTML within Markdown (sometimes) so I also included the HTML version of this feature.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`==Highlighted==

<mark>Highlighted</mark>`}
/>

### Superscript/Subscript

The second to last extended Markdown feature we will cover is superscript and subscript text. To create superscript text you can wrap your text with a `^` character and to create subscript text you can wrap your text with a `~` character. This again does not work with GitHub Flavored Markdown so I have included the HTML version of this feature.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`This is a ^superscript^

This is a ~subscript~

This is a <sup>superscript</sup>

This is a <sub>subscript</sub>`}
/>

### Emoji

The last extended Markdown feature we will cover is ading emojis. To add an emoji you can just type `:EMOJI_NAME:` and it will be converted to an emoji. This feature is much less widely supported than some of the other extended Markdown features covered up to this point and does not work with GitHub Flavored Markdown, but you can just copy the emoji into your Markdown and it will work.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`:smile:
  
ðŸ˜Š`}
/>

## Handling Code

One of the most common uses of Markdown is to display code. By default you can display code inline or in a code block.

### Inline Code

To display code inline you can wrap your code in a single `` ` `` character. This is useful for displaying small snippets of code within a paragraph.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`This is \`inline code\` within a paragraph.`}
/>

### Code Blocks

To display a larger block of code you can wrap your code in three `` ` `` characters. You can also specify the language of your code block by adding the language name after the three `` ` `` characters. This will add syntax highlighting to your code block. This is an extended feature of Markdown, but nearly every Markdown flavor supports it.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`\`\`\`js
// This is a code block
const a = 1;
\`\`\``}
/>

You will notice that by default this code block does not have syntax highlighting. This is because rendering syntax highlighting requires extra CSS and JavaScript which is not included in this Markdown editor. My blog's code blocks, however, do have syntax highlighting so if I were to use the exact same code block within my blog it would look like this.

```js
// This is a code block
const a = 1;
```

Again, if you want to see this more in depth view the [source code for this article](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Web-Dev-Simplified-Official-Blog/tree/master/src/pages/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/index.mdx?plain=1).

## Other Elements

So far we have covered how to style text and how to display code, but Markdown also supports quite a few other elements.

### Links

To create a link you can wrap your text in square brackets and then wrap the link in parentheses. You can even do this to make relative links. Also, if you include a URL on its own it will automatically be converted to a link in some extended Markdown flavors, otherwise you can wrap it in `<>` to make it a link.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`[This is a link](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com)
  
[Relative](/2023-06/markdown-crash-course)

https://blog.webdevsimplified.com

<https://blog.webdevsimplified.com>`}
/>

### Images

Images look very similar to links since they are also wrapped in square brackets and parentheses. The only difference is that you need to add an exclamation mark before the square brackets. Also, the text in the square brackets is used as the alt text for the image while the link in the parentheses is used as the source for the image.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`![The Google Logo](/articleAssets/2023-06/markdown-crash-course/Google_Normal.png)`}
/>

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to quote another source. To create a blockquote you can add a `>` character before your text. You can also nest blockquotes by adding multiple `>` characters.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`> This is a blockquote
>> This is a nested blockquote`}
/>

### Horizontal Rule

To add a horizontal rule you can add three or more `-`, `_`, or `*` characters on a single line.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`This is above the horizontal rule

***

This is between the horizontal rules

---

This is between the horizontal rules

___

This is below the horizontal rule`}
/>

### Lists

There are two types of lists in Markdown, ordered and unordered. To create an unordered list you can add a `-`, `*`, or `+` character before each item in your list. To create an ordered list you can add a number followed by a `.` character before each item in your list. The actual order of the numbers you use does not matter. You can also nest lists by indenting them with four spaces and/or a tab.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`- This is an unordered list
- Of items

1. This is an ordered list
2. The numbers do not matter
1. This says 3
    * This is a nested list
    * Of items
        1. This is a nested
        2. List of items`}
/>

### Tables

The second to last element we will cover is tables. Tables are a bit more complicated than the other elements we have covered so far. To create a table you need to create a list of rows where each column is separated by a `|` and each row starts and ends with a `|` as well. Below the first row you need to add a row where each column consists of at least three `-`s and optionally a `:` character on either side of the `-`s. The `:` character is used to align the text in the column. If you add a `:` character on the left side of the `-`s then the text will be left aligned. If you add a `:` character on the right side of the `-`s then the text will be right aligned. If you add a `:` character on both sides of the `-`s then the text will be center aligned. Finally, you can continue to add rows to your table with the same format as your first row. This sounds really complicated but once you see it in action it makes sense.

Also, this is an extended Markdown feature, but it does work with GitHub Flavored Markdown.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`| Col 1 | Col 2   |
| ----- | ------- |
| This  | is      |
| an    | example |
| table | with    |
| two   | columns |

| Right  | Center | Left |
| -----: | :----: | :--- |
| R      | C      | L    |

| Head One | Head Two |
| --- | --- |
| Does Not Need | To Be |
| Aligned | Properly |`}
/>

### Checklist

The last element we will cover is the checklist. This is an extended Markdown feature, but it is supported by GitHub Flavored Markdown. To create a checklist you can add a `- [ ]` or `- [x]` before each item in your list. The `- [ ]` will create an unchecked checkbox while the `- [x]` will create a checked checkbox.

<MarkdownEditor
  client:visible
  initialValue={`- [ ] Unchecked
- [x] Checked`}
/>
